# React CRUD Application with JSON Server

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React and a JSON server. It allows users to manage a list of items (e.g., users, products, tasks) through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Create new items
- View a list of existing items
- Update existing items
- Delete items

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Basic understanding of React and JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Niket-dewangan/crud-operation.git

2. Install dependencies:

npm install

## Usage

1. Start the JSON server (mock backend):

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8080

2. Start the React application:

npm start

The application will run at `http://localhost:3000`, and the JSON server will serve data from `db.json`.

## Folder Structure

- `src/components`: Contains React components (e.g., ViewUser, AddUser, EditUser).
- `data/db.json`: Mock database file with initial data.
